# GDMS-DeviceManagementSystem
Statement: Due to my recent work, I have no time to advance this project, and this project has the risk of long-term shelving

* Web-based equipment management system, Phase 1 under development (73% completed)
* The front and back ends are completely separated, using JWT to manage sessions, and the back end provides interfaces through C# controllers
* The database uses Oracle
* If you have any suggestions, or are interested in cooperation, please contact me.

#### Project Features
* It has strong versatility and can meet the equipment management needs of most industries.
* The interface is elegant; originally planned to use layuiAdmin, but it is too expensive for amateur developers and not open source, so use layui to rewrite the style, imitate the UI of layuiAdmin, and integrate a set of front-end framework to ensure that all the code is open source.
* The deployment is simple, and the deployment document will be written after the first phase of development is completed.
